# Stranger Things Friend Finder
## Do you love Netflix's "Stranger Things?"

Then find out who your Stranger Things BFF would be by taking this short quiz! This application uses Express, Node.js, jQuery, and JavaScript to calculate user compatibility with pre-set profiles for several characters from "Stranger Things." Users can complete the survey to see who their answers are most similar to. The application uses jQuery and JavaScript to loop through each user's survey answers in comparison to pre-set profiles in order to find the friends that are most compatible (have the lowest index of difference).

Yes, "Stranger Things" was playing in the background for the duration of this application's development.

This application is not officially affiliated in any way with Netflix or "Stranger Things." I do not own any of the images or fonts displayed in this application. The title card was generated using makeitstranger.com.
