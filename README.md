# Friend Finder
## An Express application for finding your new BFF

This application uses Express, Node.js, and JavaScript. Users complete a compatibility survey to find friends. The application runs through each user's survey answers in order to find the most compatible (lowest index of difference) friends.

I developed this application as a UC Berkeley Extension homework assignment emphasizing server use and Express.

## This application is deployed on Heroku:
